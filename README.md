Visual Studio

C# (.NET)

SQL Server Database

I’ll provide the correct full setup instructions for your ASP.NET (MVC or Web API) project with SQL Server, targeting developers using Visual Studio.

🛠️ Installation Guide
✅ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Visual Studio 2022 or later with .NET desktop and web development workloads

.NET SDK 6.0 or later

SQL Server (Express, Developer, or full version)

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – for managing the database

Git (optional, for cloning)

📦 Steps to Set Up the Project
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/H-M-Abdullah-Khan/Online-Help-Desk.git
cd Online-Help-Desk
Or download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

2. Open the Project in Visual Studio
Launch Visual Studio.

Go to File > Open > Project/Solution.

Select the .sln file (e.g., OnlineHelpDesk.sln) inside the repo folder.

3. Configure the SQL Server Connection
In appsettings.json (or app.config), find and update the connection string:

json
Copy
Edit
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=OnlineHelpDeskDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
}
Replace YOUR_SERVER_NAME with your actual SQL Server name (e.g., localhost\\SQLEXPRESS).

You can also use SQL Server Authentication:

json
Copy
Edit
"DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=OnlineHelpDeskDB;User Id=your_user;Password=your_password;"
4. Build the Project
In Visual Studio, go to Build > Build Solution or press Ctrl+Shift+B.

This ensures all dependencies are restored and compiled correctly.

5. Apply Migrations & Create the Database
If you’re using Entity Framework (EF Core):

Open the Package Manager Console (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console) and run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Add-Migration InitialCreate
Update-Database
This will apply all EF Core migrations and create the database in SQL Server.

If your database is already built manually via .sql script, execute schema.sql in SSMS to create necessary tables.

6. Run the Application
Press F5 or click Start Debugging in Visual Studio.

This launches the application on https://localhost:PORT (e.g., https://localhost:5001).

🚀 How to Use
Register as a new user or log in with pre-defined admin credentials (check SeedData.cs if applicable).

Create, track, and respond to tickets.

Admins can view all tickets, assign them, and manage users/agents.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions
Once the app is installed and running:

* Visit http://localhost:8000 (or your hosted domain).
* Register as a new user or login with admin credentials.
* Submit a support ticket through the “Create Ticket” page.
* Admins or agents can view the ticket queue, assign responsibilities, respond to tickets, and close them upon resolution.

Tickets will be updated in real time or via polling.
